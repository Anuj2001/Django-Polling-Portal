#Democracy

It is an Online Voting Portal.
It can be used for taking the reviews of common people.
It would be easy for government to take the reviews from the countrymen before taking or passing any bill or rule.
It is mainly feasible in Democratic Countries like India.
There are so many decisions like CAA and NRC which results into big riots across the country.
So, it is a better option to take public opinion first and then be ready for the future.
